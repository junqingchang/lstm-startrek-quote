# LSTM StarTrek Quote
Deep Learning with PyTorch
## Getting Started
Get the dataset from the link provided (if it is still up, since it is from school)

Run
```
$ python hw.py
```
that trains the model

## Sampling
Run 
```
$ python sample.py <starting character>
```
This will provide some sample sentences like those in output.txt

You can change the model with the 5 model files provided (5 being the one with the least training loss)

## Some Samples with Max Length set to 100
