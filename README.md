# LSTM StarTrek Quote
Deep Learning with PyTorch
## Getting Started
Get the dataset from the link provided (if it is still up, since it is from school)

Run
```
$ python hw.py
```
that trains the model

## Sampling
Run 
```
$ python sample.py <starting character>
```
This will provide some sample sentences like those in output.txt

You can change the model with the 5 model files provided (5 being the one with the least training loss)

## Note
The report is no longer accurate as I found a bug in the code, fixed it and retrained the model. Refer to the images in the folder for the new losses

## Dependencies
* PyTorch
* matplotlib
